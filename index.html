    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Flippy - Page Flip PDF Reader &middot; Effective February 7, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Flippy is a PDF reader available on Android and iOS. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data Flippy accesses, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>Flippy stores all core data locally on your device. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable Cloud Sync (a premium feature).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PDF files</strong> you import into the app</li>
      <li><strong>Bookmarks, highlights, and annotations</strong> you create</li>
      <li><strong>Reading progress</strong> (current page, reading history)</li>
      <li><strong>App preferences</strong> (theme, reading settings, tags)</li>
      <li><strong>Drawings</strong> made with the draw tool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored in your device's local storage and is not accessible to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Sync (Premium Feature)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to enable Cloud Sync, the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> You sign in with your Google account via Google Sign-In. We receive your name, email address, and profile photo to display in the app. We do not store your Google password.</li>
      <li><strong>Data synced:</strong> Bookmarks, highlights, reading progress, tags, and reading statistics are stored in Google Firebase Firestore, associated with your Google account.</li>
      <li><strong>PDF files are never uploaded.</strong> Only your reading data (bookmarks, progress, etc.) is synced.</li>
      <li><strong>You can delete your cloud data</strong> at any time from the app's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Read-Aloud (Premium Feature)</h2>
    <p>Flippy offers text-to-speech powered by Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you use this feature, the <strong>text content of the current page</strong> is sent to Google's servers to generate audio.</li>
      <li>No PDF files are uploaded. Only extracted text is transmitted.</li>
      <li>Google's Text-to-Speech API processes the text and returns audio. Google's use of this data is governed by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud's Privacy Notice</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Q&amp;A and Summaries (Premium Feature)</h2>
    <p>Flippy uses Google's Gemini API to answer questions about your PDFs and generate summaries.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you use this feature, the <strong>text content of your PDF</strong> is sent to Google's Gemini API along with your question.</li>
      <li>This data is processed to generate a response and is not stored by Flippy.</li>
      <li>Google's use of this data is governed by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Gemini API Terms</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Flippy offers optional premium subscriptions. All purchases are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). We do not collect or store any payment information. Purchase management and billing are handled entirely by the respective platform.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p><strong>Flippy does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</strong> We do not collect usage data, crash reports, device identifiers, or any other telemetry. There are no ads in the app.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Flippy integrates with the following third-party services only when you explicitly use the corresponding features:</p>
